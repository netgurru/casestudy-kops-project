Sure! I can help you with that. Here's a step-by-step guide to developing a basic web application using Python, Flask framework, and Amazon S3 for CSV file processing and storage. We'll also include instructions for creating a Docker image and deploying it to Kubernetes.

Please note that the following instructions assume you have basic knowledge of Python, Flask, Docker, and Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following:
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Docker installed on your system
- An AWS account with S3 access keys

## Step 1: Set up the project
1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it.
2. Initialize a new Python virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install Flask and Boto3 (the AWS SDK for Python):
   ```
   pip install flask boto3
   ```

## Step 2: Create the Flask application
1. Create a new file called `app.py` and open it in a text editor.
2. Add the following code to set up a basic Flask application:
   ```python
   from flask import Flask, render_template, request

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/')
   def index():
       return render_template('index.html')

   @app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
   def upload():
       file = request.files['file']
       # Process the CSV file here (print the content for now)
       for line in file:
           print(line.decode('utf-8'))
       # Upload the file to S3 here
       # Implement S3 Glacier transition here
       return 'File processed and uploaded successfully!'

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True)
   ```
3. Save the file.

## Step 3: Create the HTML templates
1. Create a new directory called `templates`.
2. Inside the `templates` directory, create a new file called `index.html` and open it in a text editor.
3. Add the following HTML code to create a basic file upload form:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>CSV File Upload</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Upload a CSV File</h1>
       <form method="POST" action="/upload" enctype="multipart/form-data">
           <input type="file" name="file" accept=".csv">
           <input type="submit" value="Upload">
       </form>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
4. Save the file.

## Step 4: Configure AWS credentials
1. Open a terminal and run the following command to configure your AWS access keys:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
2. Enter your AWS access key ID and secret access key when prompted.
3. Provide a default region name and leave the output format as 'json'.

## Step 5: Upload to S3
1. In the `upload` route of `app.py`, add the code to upload the processed CSV file to S3:
   ```python
   import boto3

   # ...

   @app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
   def upload():
       file = request.files['file']
       # Process the CSV file here (print the content for now)
       for line in file:
           print(line.decode('utf-8'))
       # Upload the file to S3
       s3 = boto3.client('s3')
       s3.upload_fileobj(file, 'your-bucket-name', file.filename)
       # Implement S3 Glacier transition

 here
       return 'File processed and uploaded successfully!'
   ```

## Step 6: Implement S3 Glacier transition
To implement S3 Glacier transition, you need to configure a lifecycle policy on your S3 bucket. You can do this manually through the AWS Management Console or use the AWS CLI. Here's an example using the AWS CLI:

1. Open a terminal and run the following command to create a JSON file named `lifecycle.json`:
   ```bash
   touch lifecycle.json
   ```
2. Open `lifecycle.json` in a text editor and add the following JSON content:
   ```json
   {
       "Rules": [
           {
               "ID": "GlacierTransitionRule",
               "Filter": {
                   "Prefix": ""
               },
               "Status": "Enabled",
               "Transitions": [
                   {
                       "Days": 30,
                       "StorageClass": "GLACIER"
                   }
               ]
           }
       ]
   }
   ```
3. Save the file.
4. Run the following command to apply the lifecycle configuration to your S3 bucket:
   ```bash
   aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket your-bucket-name --lifecycle-configuration file://lifecycle.json
   ```

## Step 7: Create a Dockerfile
1. In the root directory of your project, create a new file called `Dockerfile`.
2. Open `Dockerfile` in a text editor and add the following content:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.9

   WORKDIR /app
   COPY . /app

   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

   EXPOSE 5000

   CMD ["python", "app.py"]
   ```
3. Save the file.

## Step 8: Build and push the Docker image to Docker Hub
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project.
2. Build the Docker image using the following command:
   ```bash
   docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/csv-processor .
   ```
3. Once the image is built, push it to Docker Hub:
   ```bash
   docker push your-dockerhub-username/csv-processor
   ```

## Step 9: Deploy to Kubernetes
1. Assuming you have a Kubernetes cluster set up, create a new file called `deployment.yaml` and open it in a text editor.
2. Add the following YAML content to create a deployment for your application:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: csv-processor
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: csv-processor
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: csv-processor
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: csv-processor
             image: your-dockerhub-username/csv-processor
             ports:
               - containerPort: 5000
   ```
3. Save the file.
4. Apply the deployment to your Kubernetes cluster using the following command:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```

That's it! You have now developed a basic web application to parse and process CSV files, with file upload functionality, S3 storage, Docker image creation, and Kubernetes deployment.

Note: This example is a simplified implementation to get you started. In a production environment, you would need to handle error cases, implement proper authentication, and consider additional security measures.
