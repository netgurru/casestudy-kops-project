To achieve the requirements mentioned, you can follow the steps outlined below:

1. Create a Deployment with Nginx and the web application running in the same pod. The web application should have access to shared storage for public files. Here's an example YAML file (`nginx-webapp.yaml`) for the Deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-webapp
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-webapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-webapp
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: shared-storage
          emptyDir: {}
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:latest
          volumeMounts:
            - name: shared-storage
              mountPath: /public
        - name: webapp
          image: your-webapp-image:latest
          volumeMounts:
            - name: shared-storage
              mountPath: /public
```

2. Create a Service object to expose the application. Here's an example YAML file (`service.yaml`) for creating a service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-webapp-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx-webapp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```

3. Implement auto-scaling for the Deployment. Modify the Deployment YAML (`nginx-webapp.yaml`) by adding the following section to enable Horizontal Pod Autoscaling:

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-webapp
  template:
    ...
  autoscaling:
    minReplicas: 1
    maxReplicas: 5
    targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 80
    scaleTargetRef:
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: Deployment
      name: nginx-webapp
```

This configuration scales the Deployment between 1 and 5 replicas based on CPU utilization, targeting 80% utilization.

4. Use Helm to render Kubernetes objects for reusability. Helm provides a templating engine to generate Kubernetes manifests. Here's an example Helm chart structure:

```
your-chart/
  Chart.yaml
  values.yaml
  templates/
    deployment.yaml
    service.yaml
```

In the `deployment.yaml` and `service.yaml` files inside the `templates` directory, you can use Helm templating syntax to define the Kubernetes objects and use values from the `values.yaml` file. For example, you can reference the image version or number of replicas from `values.yaml` in the Deployment template.

Once you have the Helm chart ready, you can use the Helm CLI to render Kubernetes objects:

```shell
helm template your-chart /path/to/your/chart --output-dir /path/to/rendered/objects
```

This command will render the Kubernetes objects based on the template and store them in the specified output directory.

By following these steps, you should have a deployment with Nginx and the web

 application running in the same pod, sharing public files through shared storage, exposed with a service object, and implementing auto-scaling. Additionally, you will use Ansible for configuration management and Helm for rendering reusable Kubernetes objects.
